This team creates all the activities for Project 1
There is a lot of controversy surrounding Covid Mask mandates and we wanted to see if we could determine if Mask Mandates actually impacted the spread of Covid across the globe to help policy makers understand the impact of masking and make more informed decisions about masking for future Covid-19 variants and future pandemics.

1.  Our World in Data â€“ Face Covering Policies during the Covid-19 Pandemic
2.  Kaggle - Omicron Daily Cases by Country
3.  Our World in Data - Covid-cases#cumulative-confirmed-cases-per-million-people

Key discovery during preliminary data analysis showed two “waves” of Covid-19 that occurred between 2020 and 2022 that were apparent in each country we examined.
After our research, we decided the best approach was to analyze how the timing of the mask mandates impacted the amplitude and duration of the two Covid-19 waves comparing counties on three continents, US, Europe and Asia!

Steps:
  Comparing the total number of cases reported in different countries with respect to their overall masking policies.
  Comparing the total number of cases reported in different countries while adjusting for, population size, population density, and testing rigor.
  Analyzing how the timing of the mask mandates impacted the amplitude and duration of the two Covid-19 waves.
  Final analysis indicated that 5 out of the 6 countries with the exception of Sweden did not have enough evidence to conclude that masks had an impact on the number of individuals that became infected.
